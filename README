CAM::Template::Cache

"CAM" stands for Clotho Advanced Media, www.clotho.com, which
supported most of the development of this module.  Contact us at
cpan@clotho.com.

This module extends the CAM::Template search-and-replace API with
support for caching the resulting filled text in a database.  This
relies on the exitence of a DBI-friendly database, but does have a
pair of convenience functions to help with the creation and support of
the cache table in that database.

This module is useful for creating dynamic documents that are
resource-expensive but do not change too often, like the front page of
a news site.  It is also useful for a collection of dynamic documents
that are easier to generate all at once than individually, like
multi-page results of a complex search.


Install via the usual:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The test script is lame, I know.  Sorry.

This module is released under the GNU Public License v2.  See
"COPYING" for details.

Much to my surprise, I did not find anything in CPAN that does quite
what this module does, even after looking at Cache::Cache and DBIx::*.

This module most closely resembles some combination of HTML::Template
with Cache::Cache via DBI.
